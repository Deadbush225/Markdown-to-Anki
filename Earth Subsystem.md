### Earth
- itis; **3rd** planet from the sun and the **largest** terrestrial planet
- itis; only planet that **supports life**

## **How Earth Support Life?**
#### 1. Atmosphere   
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906103344.png]]
- **oxygen** on the atmosphere by *plants* and *trees*
- **smaller presence** of *carbon dioxide* - useful to moderate planets *temperature*, absorbed by *plants*
- **atmosphere** is thick enough to prevent poisonous rays of *radiation*, acts as *filter*

#### 2. Climate  
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906103738.png]]
- **moderate** amount of *carbon dioxide* in the atmosphere
- does not go to *extreme* frequently

#### 3. Water  
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906103913.png]]
- abundant *water*, potable, safe to use, drinkable, and allows life-providing molecule to move around easily
- **waters** can be found anywhere, *(solid, liquid, gas)*

#### 4. Light 
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906104050.png]]
- photosynthesis
- each side of the planet receives sunlight *regularly*
- though some parts receives different exposure

#### 5. Sun
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906104300.png]]
- ideal distance to allow life to be *created* and to *support* it, perfect amount of *heat and light*
- *sun's* gravity keeps earth on its orbit

## Subsystems of the Earth
#### 1. Geosphere 
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906104440.png]]
##### Consists of 3 major layers
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906104507.png]]
1. Core
	- mat; heavy metals
	- 1.1. Outer Core
		- thi; 1400 miles thick
		- com; iron, alloy, and nickel
	- 1.1. Inner Core
		- thi; 750 miles thick
		- com; made up of primary iron

> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906104532.png]]
2. Mantle
	- itis; thickest part, biggest volume
	- covers **core** and lies beneath the **crust**
	- 2.1. outermost mantle
		- wcf; asthenosphere
		- cool, strong, and hard (solid)
	- 2.2. innermost mantle
		- itis; hot, rock is not stable, soft,
		- prop; plastic, **magmatic**, viscous

3. Crust
	- itis; thinnest layer
	- com; solid rock

#### 2. Hydrosphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906104830.png]]
- itis; liquid water component
- ocean makes 71% of Earth, (97.5% saltwater, 2.5% freshwater)
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906105020.png]]
- 1.8% of Earths water is frozen in glacier
	- glaciers covers 10% of land surface today 

##### Water Cycle
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906105225.png]]
1. Evaporation/(Transpiration if from plants)
	- water to water vapor
2. Condensation
	- water vapor grouped in a cloud
3. Precipitation
	- water vapor to liquid

##### **Freshwater**
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906105501.png]]
- Lake
- Stream
- River

#### 3. Atmosphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906105537.png]]
- 78% Nitrogen
- 21% Oxygen
- 1% other gases
- acts as blanket for temperature regulation/filter against the radiation from the sun

##### **Layers of Atmosphere**
> [!source-image]+
![[Pasted image 20220906105712.png]]

###### 1. Troposphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906105715.png]]
- 10 km
- Formation of weather
- Jet stream - fast flowing narrow, meandering air currents
- Tropopause - border to stratosphere

2. Stratosphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906105858.png]]
- Ozone layer - filters most of the harmful UV rays/ solar radiation
	- slowly healing 

3. Mesosphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906110049.png]]
- Middle layer
- Coldest Layer
- layer where meteors burn up upon atmospheric
	- presence of oxygen
	- the friction between the gas particles and the meteors
- mesopause - border to thermosphere

4. Thermosphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906110331.png]]
- sun's radiation strips off
- ionosphere - portion of ions from radiation removed in the atmosphere
- Aurora Borealis, Aurora Australis
- many satellites

5. Exosphere
> [!source-image]-
![[Pasted image 20220906110531.png]]
- topmost
- hydrogen and helium
- thinnest region - so thin that we can't identify it's end

#### 4.Biosphere
> [!source-image]+
![[Pasted image 20220906110657.png]]
- all living things, (microbes, plants, animals)
- bios - life
- sphaira - sphere
- extends to other subsystem
